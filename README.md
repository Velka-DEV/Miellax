Miellax is a .NET 6 library for pentesting web apps against credential stuffing attacks based on the Milky library written by Laiteux.

In fact, it will manage:
- HttpClient creation and distribution (support for backconnect proxies and all protocols using .NET 6 Native support)
- Output (directory, whether to output invalids or not, console colors, captures and more...)
- Console title (hits, free hits, estimated hits, percentages, checked per minute, elapsed/remaining time and more...)
- Check pause/resume/end functions using hotkeys

And more... See the code itself or the [examples](https://github.com/Laiteux/Miellax/blob/v3/examples) folder for a better overview.
